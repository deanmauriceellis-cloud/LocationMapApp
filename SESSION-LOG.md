- [ ] App reinstall + verify new subtypes appear in Find grid
- [ ] Verify "Boat Ramps" shows 1,324 results
- [ ] Verify "Filter and Map" works with new subtypes

## Session: 2026-03-04 (v1.5.56 — Search Distance Sort + Filter and Map UX)

### Context
User noticed fuzzy search results were sorted by relevance (fuzzy match score) instead of distance, and the "Filter and Map" button was buried at the bottom of 200+ results. Also, tapping "Filter and Map" teleported to results centroid instead of keeping current position.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fuzzy Search Distance Sort (server.js)
- Changed `ORDER BY (score) DESC, distance ASC` to `ORDER BY distance ASC`
- All search results now sorted nearest-first regardless of fuzzy match quality

#### 2. "Filter and Map" Button Moved to Top (MainActivity.kt)
- Moved teal button from bottom of `searchResultsList` to top (before result rows)
- Removed duplicate button from bottom of results

#### 3. Filter and Map — Keep Current Position + Adaptive Zoom (MainActivity.kt)
- Removed centroid calculation and `setCenter()` call
- Starts at zoom 18, steps back one level until at least one result is visible (min zoom 3)

### Files Modified (2)
- `cache-proxy/server.js` — ORDER BY change (1 line)
- `app/.../ui/MainActivity.kt` — button move, centroid removal, adaptive zoom (~30 lines)
