# LocationMapApp v1.5 — Project State

> **Snapshot only.** This file is the current-state pointer. Session-by-session history lives in `SESSION-LOG.md` (last 10 sessions) and `SESSION-LOG-ARCHIVE.md` (older). Live conversation logs are in `docs/session-logs/`. Per-file decisions and code changes are in those logs and in `git log`. Do not let this file grow into a changelog — it should stay under 200 lines.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-16 — Session 137 (HTML/WebView "The Oracle" newspaper renderer + Oracle tile brief)

---

## TOP PRIORITY — Next Session (S138)

**Wire Salem Oracle-generated 16-tile Newspaper Digests into `salem_witch_trials_articles` + device-verify the new HTML/WebView newspaper renderer.**

Master plan section: Phase 9X close-out.

S137 shipped Step 2 (HTML/WebView newspaper renderer) and wrote `docs/oracle-tile-brief.md` — complete brief for Salem Oracle to generate all 16 History panel tiles (intro, 12 months of 1692, fallout, closing, epilogue) as Oracle Newspaper Digests. Oracle is already hot from the biography run. S138 imports the Oracle output, bakes into bundled asset DB, and verifies on device.

**Post-S137 key facts:**
- **Newspaper detail dialog is now WebView/HTML.** "The Oracle" masthead + dateline/phase row + ALL-CAPS headline + italic deck + flowing justified paragraphs with gold drop cap + dotted-underline NPC cross-links. NPC taps go through `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` → bio detail dialog. Build clean, device-verify pending.
- **Oracle tile brief at `docs/oracle-tile-brief.md`** — ready for Oracle to generate.
- **BCS dedup fully resolved** (from S136). **PG: 1,837 active POIs** (1,483 narrated).
- **Walk-sim** at 1.4 m/s (realistic pace).
- **Narration dock newspaper mode** working (S136).
- **Room `@Insert` silent-drop** from S129 still latent.
- **OMEN-004 still deliberately slipped** (deadline 2026-04-30, 14 days out).

**Phase 9X status:** Newspaper UI enhancement Steps 1 + 2 shipped. Step 3 (tile content) pending Oracle output. After S138, Phase 9X is COMPLETE. Salem 400+ launch deadline 2026-09-01 still tracks.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1-9 + 9A+ + 9T (8/9) | COMPLETE | Core dev, offline foundation, ambient narration |
| **9P.A** Backend Foundation | **COMPLETE** (S98-S101) | Schema, importer, admin auth, write endpoints, duplicates, per-mode visibility |

| **9U** Unified POI Table | **DONE (S125-S126)** | Dedup, narration resync, NarrationPoint+SalemBusiness entity removal, TourPoi rerouted to salem_pois, legacy PG schema dropped, inventory PDF tool migrated. |
| **9X** Salem Witch Trials Feature | **IN PROGRESS — 7/8 sessions done (S127-S133)** | **TOP PRIORITY (S134 = final).** S127 foundation. S128 history-article LLM gen. S129 History 4×4 tile UI. S130 Oracle Newspaper panel. S131 People panel + TTS chunker. S132 pencil-sketch portraits + bug fixes. S133 cross-linking (1,110+ NPC name auto-links) + Today-in-1692 card + admin integration.

| **9Q** Salem Domain Content Bridge | not started — queued behind 9X | building→POI translation, 425 buildings, 202 newspapers. Simplified by 9U (no `poi_kind` column). |
| **9R** Historic Tour Mode | not started — queued behind 9X | opt-in chapter-based 1692 tour |
| **10** Production readiness | DEFERRED behind 9X+9Q+9R | Firebase, photos, DB hardening, emulator verification |

**Sessions completed:** 137. Salem 400+ quadricentennial is 2026 — app must be in Play Store by Sept to capture October's 1M+ visitors.

## Carry-forward Items (NOT blocking Phase 9U)

**Still pending (carry into S120+):**
- **Heading-up rotation smoothness** — root cause identified in S115 (100 Hz sensor + main-thread saturation). Plan: cut log chatter, rate-limit apply, move sensor processing to background HandlerThread, switch static detection to wall-clock. **Scheduled for S120 Step 9U.17.**
- **`DWELL_MS = 3_000L` dead code** in `NarrationGeofenceManager` — declared, never wired.
- **GPS journey line backgrounding bug** — diagnosed S112; fix options proposed but not implemented.
- **DB wipe across APK reinstalls** — `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`. Replace with real Room migrations before Play Store.
- **walkSimMode gap-timing differences** — revisit if walk-sim should be 100% indistinguishable from real GPS.
- **Bearing filter cone is 90°** — operator may want to tighten.
- **Admin tool POI creation** — currently only edits existing POIs; Phase 9U BCS import adds 900+ new POIs which partially addresses this.
- **POI encounter review screen** — future in-app debug menu feature.
- **Pre-existing GPS log redundancy** — 4 lines from 4 layers per fix.
- **Narration sheet has no `setPeekHeight`** — 168dp workaround handles common case.
- **PRE-PRODUCTION HARD-DELETE: dedup loser rows** — S123 soft-deleted **110 duplicate POIs** across two passes: 86 from name-based pass (`data_source LIKE '%dedup-2026-04-13-loser%'`) + 24 from address-based pass (`data_source LIKE '%address-dedup-2026-04-13-loser%'`). Before Play Store APK build, hard-delete these so they don't ship in the bundled Room DB. Plan: `DELETE FROM salem_pois WHERE data_source LIKE '%dedup-2026-04-13-loser%' OR data_source LIKE '%address-dedup-2026-04-13-loser%';` (verify zero FK refs first). Dedup scripts: `cache-proxy/scripts/dedup-2026-04-13/`. Operator rule applied: rows with unique `intel_entity_id` (BCS) are kept regardless of address collision.

## OMEN Open Items

1. **NOTE-L014 / OMEN-008 — Privacy Policy** — **DRAFTED S114 at `docs/PRIVACY-POLICY.md`**. Pending OMEN review. Ball is in OMEN's court.
2. **NOTE-L015 — `~/Development/SalemCommercial/` cutover never executed.** 12 sessions running. Needs OMEN to execute or retract.
3. **OMEN-002 history rotation** — operator action only.
4. **OMEN-004 — first real Kotlin unit test** (Phase 1 deadline 2026-04-30, 18 days out).
5. **Phase 9T.9 walk simulator end-to-end verification** still TODO.
6. **Cross-project: SalemIntelligence** — Phase 1 KB live. Phase 2 (narration gen) pending operator gate. Hero regen deferred behind Phase 2.
7. ~~**Cross-project: stale intel_entity_id UUIDs in salem_pois**~~ — **CLOSED S125 2026-04-14 (commit `870733b`).** Self-resolved on LMA's side via `cache-proxy/scripts/dedup-stale-intel-links.js`. Pulled SI's `/api/intel/poi-export` (1597 canonical entities), probed every LMA linkage, fuzzy-matched stale UUIDs by name + coord + `/context` validity, then re-linked survivors and soft-deleted the rest. Outcome: 12 canonicals re-linked (chezcasa, lafayette_hotel, rockafellas_restaurant, the_village + 8 others), 211 soft-deleted with `data_source LIKE '%dedup-stale-uuid-2026-04-14-loser%'` (pending pre-Play-Store hard-delete), 0 stale linkages remaining. Bonus: fixed a `generate-narration-from-intel.js` bug that was aborting on GET 404 instead of falling through to POST `/generate` — any future rerun now correctly synthesizes narrations for SI-known-but-uncached entities. No OMEN action required.

## Salem Oracle & SalemIntelligence Integration

**Two distinct services now available:**
- **Salem Oracle** at `:8088` — 1692 historical corpus (63 POIs, NPCs, trial events, newspapers). Used by admin tool's "Generate with AI" feature (Phase 9P.10b).
- **SalemIntelligence** at `:8089` — modern business KB (1,724 BCS entities, 116K total entities, 238 historic buildings, 5.67M relations). Build-time data source for Phase 9U POI import. Integration guide: `~/Development/SalemIntelligence/docs/lma-integration-guide.md`.

---

## Expanded vision (updated S123)

- **Phase 9U** — Unified POI Table + BCS Import. 1 session left (S124). Legacy cleanup + heading-up fix + admin historical_note field. **NEXT.**
- **Phase 9P.C** — Publish loop. Operational (publish-salem-pois.js shipped S118).
- **Phase 9Q** — Salem Domain Content Bridge. 2-3 sessions. Simplified by 9U unified table.
- **Phase 9R** — Historic Tour Mode. 4-6 sessions.

**Total runway:** ~9-12 sessions for 9U(cleanup)+9Q+9R. Launch deadline Sept 1, 2026.
- **S119 parking lot** — 29 items triaged into master plan backlog. See `WickedSalemWitchCityTour_MASTER_PLAN.md` → "Backlog — S119 Parking Lot Triage".

---

## POI Inventory

- **Current PG:** **1,837 active POIs** in `salem_pois` (1,483 narrated). S136 BCS re-import + orphan cleanup (93 soft-deleted) + LMA-side dedup (4 soft-deleted). All BCS-vs-BCS dupes resolved.
- **Room DB:** published from PG, in sync (1,837 rows).
- **Inventory PDF tool:** `tools/generate-poi-inventory-pdf.py`
