# LocationMapApp v1.5 — Project State

> **Snapshot only.** This file is the current-state pointer. Session-by-session history lives in `SESSION-LOG.md` (last 10 sessions) and `SESSION-LOG-ARCHIVE.md` (older). Live conversation logs are in `docs/session-logs/`. Per-file decisions and code changes are in those logs and in `git log`. Do not let this file grow into a changelog — it should stay under 200 lines.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-14 — Session 125 (23 commits: overnight-test fixes, 100% narration coverage, stale UUID sweep, legacy tour restoration, admin→SI bridge, walk-sim UX)

---

## TOP PRIORITY — Next Session (S126)

**Field-test the S125 output + continue Phase 9U cleanup.**

Immediate verification (need real-world walk to prove out):
1. **4 non-Heritage tours** with random-start + Historical Mode + OSRM route backfill. Pick each of tour_essentials / tour_explorer / tour_grand / tour_witch_trials from the selection screen, tap Walk from Beverly, confirm:
   - Walker spawns near a random tour stop (toast names it).
   - Walker follows actual streets (OSRM polyline) not straight lines between stops.
   - Narration fires immediately at the spawn stop, continues at subsequent stops.
   - Modern POIs (shops / auto-repair / law offices) stay silent — only tour stops + historical_note POIs narrate.
   - Tap "POI" FAB → all POIs narrate + all markers show; tap again → filter restores.
2. **Admin tool** at http://localhost:4302/ — verify PoiEditDialog AI-assist button works via SI (`:8089`) adapter.
3. **admin_dirty flag** — edit a POI via the admin UI, confirm `admin_dirty=TRUE` in PG.

Deferred from Session 124 scope (still open):
- Drop legacy tables (narration_points, tour_pois, salem_businesses) from Room DB.
- Remove NarrationPoint entity/DAO and legacy repository methods.
- Heading-up rotation smoothness — currently **disabled** via `HEADING_UP_ENABLED=false`; redesign needed (GPS noise + sensor freeze). Code preserved.
- Admin `historical_note` field surfacing on General tab.

**Post-S125 key facts:**
- PG: **1,868 active POIs** (211 soft-deleted this session by the stale-UUID sweep; tagged `dedup-stale-uuid-2026-04-14-loser` for pre-Play-Store hard-delete).
- **Narration coverage: 2,079 / 1,868 = 100%** — every live POI has short_narration (12 via SI re-link, 194 from SI cache, 228 local stubs for POIs SI doesn't know, rest pre-existing).
- **historical_note coverage** on tour-relevant categories: TOURISM_HISTORY 101/131, ENTERTAINMENT-with-year 13/13, PARKS_REC 3/65 (most are unlinked), WORSHIP 6/10.
- **34 unlinked POIs** still carry local stubs (no SI entity at all — truly SI-unknown, not stale linkage).
- **5 tours** restored and visible on the tour-selection screen: Heritage Trail (10), Walking Through Salem (14), Salem Explorer (20), Grand Salem Tour (24), Salem Witch Trials Walking Tour (19). All have OSRM walking polylines.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1-9 + 9A+ + 9T (8/9) | COMPLETE | Core dev, offline foundation, ambient narration |
| **9P.A** Backend Foundation | **COMPLETE** (S98-S101) | Schema, importer, admin auth, write endpoints, duplicates, per-mode visibility |
| **9P.B** Admin UI | **6/8 done** | 9P.6-9P.10b complete. Pending: 9P.11 (demoted), 9P.13 (folded into 9U). 9P.10a blocked on 9Q. |
| **9U** Unified POI Table | **S123 DONE (dedup + narration resync)** | 1 session left (S124). Legacy table drop, NarrationPoint removal, heading-up fix. |
| **9Q** Salem Domain Content Bridge | not started | building→POI translation, 425 buildings, 202 newspapers. Simplified by 9U (no `poi_kind` column). |
| **9R** Historic Tour Mode | not started | opt-in chapter-based 1692 tour |
| **10** Production readiness | DEFERRED behind 9U+9Q+9R | Firebase, photos, DB hardening, emulator verification |
| **11** Branding, ASO, Play Store | target 2026-09-01 | Salem 400+ launch window |
| **Cross-project** SalemIntelligence | **Phase 1 KB LIVE** at :8089 | 1,724 BCS POIs, 116K entities, 238 buildings, 5.67M relations. Phase 2 (narration gen) pending operator gate. |

**Sessions completed:** 123. Salem 400+ quadricentennial is 2026 — app must be in Play Store by Sept to capture October's 1M+ visitors.

## Carry-forward Items (NOT blocking Phase 9U)

**Still pending (carry into S120+):**
- **Heading-up rotation smoothness** — root cause identified in S115 (100 Hz sensor + main-thread saturation). Plan: cut log chatter, rate-limit apply, move sensor processing to background HandlerThread, switch static detection to wall-clock. **Scheduled for S120 Step 9U.17.**
- **`DWELL_MS = 3_000L` dead code** in `NarrationGeofenceManager` — declared, never wired.
- **GPS journey line backgrounding bug** — diagnosed S112; fix options proposed but not implemented.
- **DB wipe across APK reinstalls** — `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`. Replace with real Room migrations before Play Store.
- **walkSimMode gap-timing differences** — revisit if walk-sim should be 100% indistinguishable from real GPS.
- **Bearing filter cone is 90°** — operator may want to tighten.
- **Admin tool POI creation** — currently only edits existing POIs; Phase 9U BCS import adds 900+ new POIs which partially addresses this.
- **POI encounter review screen** — future in-app debug menu feature.
- **Pre-existing GPS log redundancy** — 4 lines from 4 layers per fix.
- **Narration sheet has no `setPeekHeight`** — 168dp workaround handles common case.
- **PRE-PRODUCTION HARD-DELETE: dedup loser rows** — S123 soft-deleted **110 duplicate POIs** across two passes: 86 from name-based pass (`data_source LIKE '%dedup-2026-04-13-loser%'`) + 24 from address-based pass (`data_source LIKE '%address-dedup-2026-04-13-loser%'`). Before Play Store APK build, hard-delete these so they don't ship in the bundled Room DB. Plan: `DELETE FROM salem_pois WHERE data_source LIKE '%dedup-2026-04-13-loser%' OR data_source LIKE '%address-dedup-2026-04-13-loser%';` (verify zero FK refs first). Dedup scripts: `cache-proxy/scripts/dedup-2026-04-13/`. Operator rule applied: rows with unique `intel_entity_id` (BCS) are kept regardless of address collision.

## OMEN Open Items

1. **NOTE-L014 / OMEN-008 — Privacy Policy** — **DRAFTED S114 at `docs/PRIVACY-POLICY.md`**. Pending OMEN review. Ball is in OMEN's court.
2. **NOTE-L015 — `~/Development/SalemCommercial/` cutover never executed.** 12 sessions running. Needs OMEN to execute or retract.
3. **OMEN-002 history rotation** — operator action only.
4. **OMEN-004 — first real Kotlin unit test** (Phase 1 deadline 2026-04-30, 18 days out).
5. **Phase 9T.9 walk simulator end-to-end verification** still TODO.
6. **Cross-project: SalemIntelligence** — Phase 1 KB live. Phase 2 (narration gen) pending operator gate. Hero regen deferred behind Phase 2.
7. ~~**Cross-project: stale intel_entity_id UUIDs in salem_pois**~~ — **CLOSED S125 2026-04-14 (commit `870733b`).** Self-resolved on LMA's side via `cache-proxy/scripts/dedup-stale-intel-links.js`. Pulled SI's `/api/intel/poi-export` (1597 canonical entities), probed every LMA linkage, fuzzy-matched stale UUIDs by name + coord + `/context` validity, then re-linked survivors and soft-deleted the rest. Outcome: 12 canonicals re-linked (chezcasa, lafayette_hotel, rockafellas_restaurant, the_village + 8 others), 211 soft-deleted with `data_source LIKE '%dedup-stale-uuid-2026-04-14-loser%'` (pending pre-Play-Store hard-delete), 0 stale linkages remaining. Bonus: fixed a `generate-narration-from-intel.js` bug that was aborting on GET 404 instead of falling through to POST `/generate` — any future rerun now correctly synthesizes narrations for SI-known-but-uncached entities. No OMEN action required.

## Salem Oracle & SalemIntelligence Integration

**Two distinct services now available:**
- **Salem Oracle** at `:8088` — 1692 historical corpus (63 POIs, NPCs, trial events, newspapers). Used by admin tool's "Generate with AI" feature (Phase 9P.10b).
- **SalemIntelligence** at `:8089` — modern business KB (1,724 BCS entities, 116K total entities, 238 historic buildings, 5.67M relations). Build-time data source for Phase 9U POI import. Integration guide: `~/Development/SalemIntelligence/docs/lma-integration-guide.md`.

---

## Expanded vision (updated S123)

- **Phase 9U** — Unified POI Table + BCS Import. 1 session left (S124). Legacy cleanup + heading-up fix + admin historical_note field. **NEXT.**
- **Phase 9P.C** — Publish loop. Operational (publish-salem-pois.js shipped S118).
- **Phase 9Q** — Salem Domain Content Bridge. 2-3 sessions. Simplified by 9U unified table.
- **Phase 9R** — Historic Tour Mode. 4-6 sessions.

**Total runway:** ~9-12 sessions for 9U(cleanup)+9Q+9R. Launch deadline Sept 1, 2026.
- **S119 parking lot** — 29 items triaged into master plan backlog. See `WickedSalemWitchCityTour_MASTER_PLAN.md` → "Backlog — S119 Parking Lot Triage".

---

## POI Inventory

- **Current PG:** **2,080 active POIs** in `salem_pois` (1,543 narrated, 1,555 with long_narration, 1,417 with short_narration). 110 soft-deleted by S123 dedup, pending pre-Play-Store hard-delete. Multipass columns dropped.
- **Room DB:** stale until next bundle export (will reflect 2,080 once published).
- **Inventory PDF tool:** `tools/generate-poi-inventory-pdf.py`
